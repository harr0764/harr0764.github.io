            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Ruby. In my free time, I enjoy rock climbing adventures and cherish quality time with friends, including my wonderful boyfriend, Dante. At home, I live with my wiener dog, Banjo, and my cat, who will be reaching his 16<sup>th</sup> year; <abbr title="McDonalds">Mac</abbr>. I also share a house with my parents and my three younger siblings. Recently, I've become <em>super</em> interested in trying new things, coding becoming one of my current favorites... thanks to this class. Despite my slow start to coding, I'm determined to get better at it. In the near future, I hope to also try origami and pottery.</p>
            <p>I'm also an avid collector, surrounded by an abundance of random collectibles, creepy things, and last but definitely not least; <strong>plushies.</strong> I have a bit of a soft spot for adorable Pokémon, and lately I've been <em>obsessed</em> with Pokémon GO. When it comes to entertainment, I also enjoy watching shows, and my favorites are <q>Rick and Morty</q> and <q>Disenchantment.</q> And <em>of course</em>, my deepest affections are reserved for cereal, bubble tea, and sushi.</p>
