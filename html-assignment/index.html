            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Ruby. In my free time i enjoy rock climbing adventures and I cherish quality time with friends, including my wonderful boyfriend, Dante. At home, I live with my weiner dog, Banjo, and my old 14yr old cat, Mac. I also share a house with my parents and my three younger siblings. Recently, I've become super interested in trying new things, coding becoming one of my current favourites, thanks to this class. Despite my slow start to coding, im determined to get better at it. In the future i hope to also try origami and pottery. </p>
            <p>I'm also an avid collector, surrounded by an abundance of random collectibles, creepy things, and last but definitely not least;plushies. I have a bit of a soft spot for adorable Pokémon, and lately I've been <em>obssesed</em> with Pokémon GO. When it comes to entertainemnt, I also enjoy watching shows, and my favourites are <q>Rick and Morty</q> and <q>Disenchantment.</q>And of course, my deepest affections are reserved for cereal, bubble tea, and sushi.</p>
